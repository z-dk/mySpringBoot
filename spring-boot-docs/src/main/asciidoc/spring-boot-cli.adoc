[[cli]]
= Spring Boot CLI

[partintro]
--
The Spring Boot CLI is a command line tool that can be used if you want to quickly
prototype with Spring. It allows you to run Groovy scripts, which means that you have a
familiar Java-like syntax, without so much boilerplate code.
--



[[cli-installation]]
== Installing the CLI
The Spring Boot CLI can be installed manually; using GVM (the Groovy Environment
Manually) or using Homebrew if you are an OSX user. See
'<<getting-started.adoc#getting-started-installing-the-cli>>'
in the ``Getting started'' section for comprehensive installation instructions.



[[cli-using-the-cli]]
== Using the CLI
Once you have installed the CLI you can run it by typing `spring`. If you run `spring`
without any arguments, a simple help screen is displayed:

[indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
	$ spring
	usage: spring [--help] [--version]
	       <command> [<args>]

	Available commands are:

	  run [options] <files> [--] [args]
	    Run a spring groovy script

	  _... more command help is shown here_
----

You can use `help` to get more details about any of the supported commands. For example:

[indent=0]
----
	$ spring help run
	spring run - Run a spring groovy script

	usage: spring run [options] <files> [--] [args]

	Option                     Description
	------                     -----------
	--autoconfigure [Boolean]  Add autoconfigure compiler
	                             transformations (default: true)
	--classpath, -cp           Additional classpath entries
	-e, --edit                 Open the file with the default system
	                             editor
	--no-guess-dependencies    Do not attempt to guess dependencies
	--no-guess-imports         Do not attempt to guess imports
	-q, --quiet                Quiet logging
	-v, --verbose              Verbose logging of dependency
	                             resolution
	--watch                    Watch the specified file for changes
----

The `version` command provides a quick way to check which version of Spring Boot you are
using.

[indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
	$ spring version
	Spring CLI v{spring-boot-version}
----



[[cli-run]]
=== Running applications using the CLI
You can compile and run Groovy source code using the `run` command. The Spring Boot CLI
is completely self contained so you don't need any external Groovy installation.

Here is an example ``hello world'' web application written in Groovy:

[source,groovy,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
	@RestController
	class WebApplication {

		@RequestMapping("/")
		String home() {
			"Hello World!"
		}

	}
----



[[cli-deduced-grab-annotations]]
==== Deduced ``grab'' dependencies
Standard Groovy includes a `@Grab` annotation which allows you to declare dependencies
on a third-party libraries. This useful technique allows Groovy to download jars in the
same way as Maven or Gradle would; but without requiring you to use a build tool.

Spring Boot extends this technique further, and will attempt to deduce which libraries
to ``grab'' based on your code. For example, since the `WebApplication` code above uses
`@RestController` annotations, ``Tomcat'' and ``Spring MVC'' will be grabbed.

The following items are used as ``grab hints'':

|===
| Items | Grabs

|`JdbcTemplate`, `NamedParameterJdbcTemplate`, `DataSource`
|JDBC Application.

|`@EnableJmsMessaging`
|JMS Application.

|`@Test`
|JUnit.

|`@EnableRabbitMessaging`
|RabbitMQ.

|`@EnableReactor`
|Project Reactor.

|extends `Specification`
|Spock test.

|`@EnableBatchProcessing`
|Spring Batch.

|`@MessageEndpoint` `@EnableIntegrationPatterns`
|Spring Integration.

|`@EnableDeviceResolver`
|Spring Mobile.

|`@Controller` `@RestController` `@EnableWebMvc`
|Spring MVC + Embedded Tomcat.

|`@EnableWebSecurity`
|Spring Security.

|`@EnableTransactionManagement`
|Spring Transaction Management.
|===

TIP: See subclasses of
{sc-spring-boot-cli}/compiler/CompilerAutoConfiguration.{sc-ext}[`CompilerAutoConfiguration`]
in the Spring Boot CLI source code to understand exactly how customizations are applied.



[[cli-default-import-statements]]
==== Default import statements
To help reduce the size of your Groovy code, several `import` statements are
automatically included. Notice how the example above refers to `@Component`,
`@RestController` and `@RequestMapping` without needing to use
fully-qualified names or `import` statements.

TIP: Many Spring annotations will work without using `import` statements. Try running
your application to see what fails before adding imports.



[[cli-automatic-main-method]]
==== Automatic main method
Unlike the equilvement Java application, you do not need to include a
`public static void main(String[] args)` method with your `Groovy` scripts. A
`SpringApplication` is automatically created, with your compiled code acting as the
`source`.



[[cli-testing]]
=== Testing your code
The `test` command allows you to compile and run tests for your application. Typical
usage looks like this:

[indent=0]
----
	$ spring test app.groovy tests.groovy
	Total: 1, Success: 1, : Failures: 0
	Passed? true
----

In this example, `tests.groovy` contains JUnit `@Test` methods or Spock `Specification`
classes. All the common framework annotations and static methods should be available to
you without having to `import` them.

Here is the `test.groovy` file that we used above (with a JUnit test):

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
	class ApplicationTests {

		@Test
		void homeSaysHello() {
			assertEquals("Hello World", new WebApplication().home())
		}

	}
----

TIP: If you have more than one test source files, you might prefer to organize them
into a `test` directory.



[[cli-multiple-source-files]]
=== Applications with multiple source files
You can use ``shell globbing'' with all commands that accept file input. This allows you
to easily use multiple files from a single directory, e.g.

[indent=0]
----
	$ spring run *.groovy
----

This technique can also be useful if you want to segregate your ``test'' or ``spec'' code
from the main application code:

[indent=0]
----
	$ spring test app/*.groovy test/*.groovy
----



[[cli-jar]]
=== Packaging your application
You can use the `jar` command to package your application into a self-contained
executable jar file. For example:

[indent=0]
----
	$ spring jar my-app.jar *.groovy
----

The resulting jar will contain the classes produced by compiling the application and all
of the application's dependencies so that it can then be run using `java -jar`. The jar
file will also contain entries from the application's classpath.

See the output of `spring help jar` for more information.



[[cli-shell]]
=== Using the embedded shell
Spring Boot includes command-line completion scripts for BASH and zsh shells. If you
don't use either of these shells (perhaps you are a Windows user) then you can use the
`shell` command to launch an integrated shell.

[indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
	$ spring shell
	*Spring Boot* (v{spring-boot-version})
	Hit TAB to complete. Type \'help' and hit RETURN for help, and \'exit' to quit.
----

From inside the embedded shell you can run other commands directly:

[indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
	$ version
	Spring CLI v{spring-boot-version}
----

The embedded shell supports ANSI color output as well as `tab` completion. If you need
to run a native command you can use the `$` prefix. Hitting `ctrl-c` will exit the
embedded shell.

[[cli-groovy-beans-dsl]]
== Developing application with the Groovy beans DSL
Spring Framework 4.0 has native support for a `beans{}` ``DSL'' (borrowed from
http://grails.org/[Grails]),  and you can embed bean definitions in your Groovy
application scripts using the same format. This is sometimes a good way to include
external features like middleware declarations. For example:

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
	@Configuration
	class Application implements CommandLineRunner {

		@Autowired
		SharedService service

		@Override
		void run(String... args) {
			println service.message
		}

	}

	import my.company.SharedService

	beans {
		service(SharedService) {
			message "Hello World"
		}
	}
----

You can mix class declarations with `beans{}` in the same file as long as they stay at
the top level, or you can put the beans DSL in a separate file if you prefer.



[[cli-whats-next]]
== What to read next
There are some {github-code}/spring-boot-cli/samples[sample groovy
scripts] available from the GitHub repository that you can use to try out the
Spring Boot CLI. There is also extensive javadoc throughout the
{sc-spring-boot-cli}[source code].

If you find that you reach the limit of the CLI tool, you will probably want to look
at converting your application to full Gradle or Maven built ``groovy project''. The
next section covers Spring Boot's
'<<build-tool-plugins.adoc#build-tool-plugins, Build tool plugins>>' that you can
use with Gradle or Maven.
